      Mathematics is used in science for modeling phenomena
      which then allows predictions to be made from experimental laws
      The independence of mathematical truth from
      any  experimentation implies that the accuracy
      of such predictions depends only on the adequacy of the model

      Inaccurate predictions, rather than being caused by incorrect mathematics,
      imply the need to change the mathematical model used
